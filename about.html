            Hi, my name's Kenneth Swegman, and I'm a Computer Scientist. <br><br>

            I started my personal career in computers working as a work/study at La Roche University. 
            There I utilized my skill and knowledge in Office365. I utilized products such as Word, Powerpoint, and Excel. Through that experience, it helped me troubleshoot
            problems quickly, as well as help me communicate to the person experiencing the problem.

            <br><br>
            I did the work/study from 2015 to 2017, and at this time in school, I was mainly studying Java. It's in this time, I secured my first Internship with Duquesne Light Co. in the spring of 2017.
            
            <br><br>
            During my first internship with DLC in the Summer of 2017, I learned Web Development for the first time. It was a fun and challenging time!
            My first project I had was working as a QA on an in-house app called StormTracker.
            I also shadowed multiple developers, the two I mainly worked with dealt in C# and React.

            <br><br>
            I did not go back in 2018 to DLC. So, I felt that I had to stay busy in another way. So, I signed up for summer classes, and I really challenged myself. 
            I took a class that I thought was extremely interesting, Intro to Mathematical Neuroscience. In that class, we had a massive final paper, which encapsulates, our notes, and our understanding in the subject.
            It is an extremely complex subject, and it was my first time learning LaTex. I have the paper to view <a href="Introduction_to_Mathematical_Neuroscience_Kenny.pdf">here</a>, if it interests you.
            During 2018, I also ignited my passion for Cyber Security.

            <br><br>
            In the Summer of 2019 I returned to DLC. With a different role, instead of just being a general IT Intern, I was on the Dev/Ops team in DLC.
            I had no experience with the Cloud, just like my previous internship, when I had zero experience in Web Dev. I learned fast though! I created my first VM day one! Not long after, I was creating servers, databases, and vms.
            I learned how to be an Azure Admin, and also how to develop using the cloud platform. After showing proficiency using Azure, I was given a task to create a data pipeline for the weather data at DLC.
            So I was able to utilze my skill in Development, with my new skill using the cloud. Utilizing Logic Apps in Azure, I was able to make a pipeline coming from a CSV file to a SQL DB.
            I also displayed presentable data to end users, using PowerBI. Thanks to my friends in the BI Department at DLC. If you want to see my powerpoint presentation from the internship, it can be found <a href="kswegmanpres.pdf">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            Currently I am studying for the Security+ Certification, and looking for a position in the Cyber Security field.
        </p>
